## Tasks Search for images
Create the front-end part of the application for searching and viewing images by keyword. Add design of interface elements.

#### HTTP requests
For the backend, use the public API of the Pixabay service. Register, get your unique access key and read the documentation.

#### Gallery and image card
The div.gallery element is initially contained in the HTML document, and the markup of the image cards must be rendered into it. When searching for a new keyword, you must clear the gallery content completely to avoid mixing up the results.

#### Pagination
The Pixabay API supports pagination and provides page and per_page parameters. Make it so that 40 objects come in each answer (20 by default).
